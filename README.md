# Texture Graph Node Language
This language allows core nodes to be programmed for the application. The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/oxi-dev0/Texture-Graph/tree/main/src/Nodes)  
There is a [VSCode Syntax Highlighting plugin](https://github.com/oxi-dev0/TGNL) available for TGNL. A VS2022 extension will be coming too.
