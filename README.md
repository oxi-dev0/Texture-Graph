## Task List for v1.0
| Issue / Improvement | Complete |
| --- | --- |
| Some nodes broke after Core Functions were introduced |x|
| Deleting nodes will sometimes cause relation issues, with evaluating and serialization | |
| Mouse switching views while inputs are being processed will sometimes cause both views to handle inputs | |
| Graph editor view background is buggy | |
| Evaluation is inefficient, and slow | |
| GUI Overhaul | |
| Needs 3D Viewer and maybe material system | |
| TGNL is badly formatted and unintuitive |x|
